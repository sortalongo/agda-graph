# Data.Graph

Implements inductive graphs (see [*Inductive Graphs and Functional Graph
Algorithms*](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/InductiveGraphs_JFP01.pdf))
in Agda.

This is just an experiment for fun. I considered trying to upstream this to the
stdlib, which only supports acyclic graphs, but didn't feel like putting in the
effort to clean it up and implement important utilities.
